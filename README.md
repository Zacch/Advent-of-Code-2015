# Advent-of-Code-2015
My code written to solve the problems in [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

Note that I started three years late, and I'm not done yet ðŸ˜Ž. I was learning [Go](https://golang.org/), so I used it for the first eight days. However, Go is not much fun so I switched to [Swift](https://www.swift.org/) and completed a few days more. Then December 2018 came along, and I switched over to doing [the AoC 2018 solutions](https://github.com/Zacch/Advent-of-Code-2018) instead.

It's now December 2022, I've finished [AoC 2022](https://github.com/Zacch/Advent-of-Code-2022) and I'm tackling the last problems in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Let's see if I finish this time!
