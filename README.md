# Advent-of-Code-2015
My code written to solve the problems in [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

I started three years late... I was learning [Go](https://golang.org/), so I used that for the first eight days. However, Go is not much fun so I switched to [Swift](https://www.swift.org/) and completed a few days more. Then December 2018 came along, and I was suddenly busy with [the AoC 2018 solutions](https://github.com/Zacch/Advent-of-Code-2018) instead.

Finally, in December 2022, after finishing [AoC 2022](https://github.com/Zacch/Advent-of-Code-2022), I tackled the last problems in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
