# Advent-of-Code-2015
My code written to solve the problems in [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

Note that I started three years late, and I'm not done yet ðŸ˜Ž. I was learning [Go](https://golang.org/), so I used it for the first eight days. However, Go is not much fun so I switched to Swift and completed eight more days before something else came up.

One of these days I'm going to finish the rest of the puzzles!
